## 🎬 Your 5-Minute Demo (Step-by-Step):

### Preparation (Before judges arrive):
1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to project: `cd ~/Documents/university/SIH/plank-1`
3. Have `PRESENTATION_QUICK_REF.txt` visible
4. Close unnecessary applications
5. Ready? Deep breath! 💪

### During Presentation:

**Minute 1-2: Professional Demo**
```bash
python3 DEMO_PROFESSIONAL.py --source "Real_Time_Vids/good flow.mov"
```

Say:
- "This is our Marine Plankton AI Monitoring System"

- "6 species classification with confidence scores"
- "Processing 20-30 frames per second"
- "Detection rate graph shows trends over time"

**Minute 3: Show Flexibility**
Press 'q' to quit, then optionally show:
```bash
python3 DEMO_COMPARISON.py \
    --models "Downloaded models/best.pt" "Downloaded models/yolov8n.pt" \
    --source "Real_Time_Vids/good flow.mov"
```

Say:
- "System is model-agnostic"
- "Can swap AI models with zero code changes"
- "Here's a side-by-side comparison"

**Minute 4: Data Visualization**
```bash
python3 MAP_VIEWER.py --open
```

Say:
- "All data automatically logged"
- "Interactive geographic visualization"
- "Perfect for field research"

**Minute 5: Wrap-up**
Say:
- "Production-ready system"
- "Works on laptops for high-performance"
- "Optimized for Raspberry Pi for field deployment"
- "Applications: research, aquaculture, conservation"
- "Questions?"

## 🎓 Sample Script:

### Opening:
"Hello judges. We present a Marine Plankton AI Monitoring System - a real-time, automated solution for marine life detection and classification."

### Demo:
*Run professional demo*
"What you see is our system processing real water samples. On the left, real-time video with AI detection. Each plankton is highlighted with a bounding box and classified by species. On the right, our live analytics dashboard shows species distribution, detection rates, and system performance. The system processes 25 frames per second with high accuracy."

### Flexibility:
"Our system is model-agnostic - we can swap AI models without any code changes. Here's a comparison of two models running side-by-side."

### Practical Application:
"All data is automatically logged with geographic coordinates. This interactive map shows detection history - perfect for field research and environmental monitoring."

### Conclusion:
"This system is production-ready. It works on laptops for high-performance analysis and Raspberry Pi for field deployment. Applications include marine research, aquaculture management, and conservation. Thank you, happy to answer questions!"
